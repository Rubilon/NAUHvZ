        <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Humans vs. Zombies is a game of tag. A few players are chosen to be 'Original Zombies' and all other players begin the game as Humans.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>The Original Zombies tag Human players and turn them into Zombies. Zombies must tag and eat a Human every 84 hours or they starve to death and are out of the game.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
        <h3>OBJECTIVES</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>The game ends when all humans have been turned to zombies, or all zombies have starved.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
        <h3>EQUIPMENT</h3>

            <ul class='rulesparagraph'>
                <li>Orange Bandana</li>

                <li>Foam Dart Blaster and/or socks</li>
				
				<li>(*)Optionally a blowgun can be made and used but it must have the following specifications:</li>
				
				<ul class='rulesparagraph'>
					
					<li>A standard blowgun can be made out of 1/2'' PVC and will fire regular nerf or buzzbee darts, a mega blowgun can be made using 3/4'' PVC.</li>
					<li>All blowguns must be under 2ft in length</li>
					<li>A blowgun requires a mouthpiece.  For the 1/2'' PVC use a 1/2'' to 3/4'' adaptor, for the 3/4'' you'll need to get a 3/4'' to 1'' adapter</li>
					<li>Blaster color restrictions apply to blowguns as well</li>
					<li>All blowguns must be lung powered.  As of this time we will not be approving blowguns that use CO2 or other propellants due to safety concerns.</li>
					<li>Blowguns must be brought to an officer at signups or in game for approval.  Approved blowguns will be marked and a moderator may ask to see your blowgun to confirm that it has been approved at any time.</li>
				</ul>

                <li>No melee weapons due to the added reach advantage as well as safety concerns</li>

                <li>NAU or Approved HvZ IDs for name-based recognition of tag reports.</li>
				
            </ul>

        <h3>SAFETY RULES</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Rules created for the safety of all players are strictly enforced. Violation of safety rules will result in a suspension from the game pending a ban hearing.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>No realistic looking weaponry. Due to restrictions handed to us from NAU PD guns are not allowed to be predominantly colored black, silver, brown or wood colors and have must still retain the blaze-orange tips. If you try to decorate your blaster and want to know if the design is OK, find a mod!</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Blasters may not be visible inside of university buildings or while a player is working on campus.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Follow all directions and instructions from NAU HvZ moderators. If a moderator calls out \"HOLD!\", you must move you bandana down and cease playing until directed to move your bandana back up. A moderator will hold up their special moderator bandana so all players may see it.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Players may not use wheeled transportation or play where there is traffic. If you need to travel over a road, stop playing, move to an appropriate crosswalk and cross legally.  If you are caught j-walking you may be subject to a warning or ban. If you are caught using the parking lots or parking structures as a play zone, you may be subject to a warning or a ban.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Darts must not hurt on impact. Foam dart blasters are children’s toys – it should be obvious that your blaster won’t hurt anyone. If you modify your blaster or are somehow not sure if it is safe, speak with a moderator and ask them to check your blaster.</p> 
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'> Any player who needs to get around campus on bikes or skateboards etc. must move their bandana down or remove their bandana when they ride and put the bandana above the elbow when they are ready to walk away from their locked bike or when they get off their skateboard. We try to discourage these modes of transportation because they take away from playing the game. Unless you've got 20 minutes to get between North and South Campus classes, please walk and play!</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'> If you are intending to smoke, either as a human or a zombie, you may move your bandana down as mentioned above while smoking. This is to protect other players from being harmed by rushing into you and touching the lit end of the cigarette. If you are doing this, please remain still until you have finished smoking if at all possible. If you are surrounded by members of the opposing side while you smoke, you may move away from them to safely enter the game without being immediately tagged or stunned.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>SAFE AREAS - You may stay or run into these areas to avoid tags</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Anywhere inside a building is a safe area. The line of safety is at the first (outermost) doors of the building.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>A Zombie must have both feet outside of a safe zone to tag a human. Humans can stun Zombies from anywhere inside of a safe zone. If this will block flow of traffic for non-players it is advised that players step away from the exit and wait until things are clear or move to another exit.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>(*) If a zombie pushes a blaster or blowgun in an attempt to deflect it, that zombie is automatically stunned, holstered blasters count as clothing.  But if a human is using their blaster or blowgun to melee stun a zombie they are automatically turned.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>NO-PLAY-ZONES - Areas where no interaction with the game is allowed. Zombies cannot reach in for a tag, humans cannot shoot out to stun a zombie, zombies cannot camp a no-play-zone, nor can humans run into a no-play-zone for safety. If a human runs into any of these areas for safety they are automatically turned into a zombie.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Outside of the Wedge to the end of the rocky area (and anywhere in the vicinity where people are obviously waiting for their food) is no-play-zone from 9pm to 2am, when people are not allowed inside. This includes the food truck.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>DO NOT enter university offices for any reason to play this game. This means no hiding in a university office or using it to look out of windows.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Other no play zones include all parking areas, including parking lots and structures, and all roads.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>If you require any type of medication (inhaler, epipen, etc.) please be sure to bring and keep it with you during game play.  We are not responsible for providing or holding any medical devices.  I.E. If you need it, bring it.</p>
				</li>
				
			</ul>
        <h3>HUMAN RULES</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Stunning a Zombie: Humans may stun a Zombie for 10 minutes by blasting them with a dart blaster or by throwing a sock and hitting them.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>When Tagged By a Zombie:</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>With Medpack: Move bandanna down below elbow, hand over your medpack, you may then move out of line of sight with the zombies before moving the bandanna back up.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Without Medpack: Immediately stow your gun. If you are unable to put it away you will need to go back to your home or dorm and put the gun away. After the gun is out of sight you may move the bandanna to your forehead and begin play as a zombie.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Wearing a Bandana: Humans must wear an orange bandana around their upper arm (between shoulder and elbow) to identify themselves as players of the game. If you are running late for class, carrying a large project, or for some other reason cannot participate in the game for a short period of time, move the bandana to your forearm to signify that you are participating in the game, but cannot actively play at this time.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Socks that have been tied together will count as a single sock upon impact no matter the number of socks in the bundle.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

        <h3>ZOMBIE RULES</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Feeding: Zombies must feed every 84 hours. A Zombie feeds by reporting their tag on the website. Tags feed 2 zombies.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Wearing an <b>orange</b> Headband: Zombies must wear an orange bandanna or strip of cloth 2 inches minimum, visibly around their heads at all times. The Original Zombies do not need to wear a headband on days 1 through 3 until 5PM. If you are running late for class, carrying a large project, or for some other reason unable to play the game for a time, pull your headband down around your neck, as if you were stunned.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Tagging: A tag is a firm touch to any part of a Human or an extension of a Human. Worn items (backpacks, jackets, etc.) count as a tag. Held items (guns, any bag in your hands, etc.) do not count as a tag. HOWEVER, IF A HUMAN IS HOLDING SOMETHING FOR USE AS A SHIELD, IT COUNTS AS A TAG. After tagging a Human, the Zombie must record the Human's ID and report the tag.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Tags now feed two zombies. When submitting the tag on the website there will be an optional slot that you can put a fellow zombie's name into to help feed them.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Getting Shot: After being hit with a dart or a sock a Zombie is stunned for 10 minutes and must pull the bandanna down around their neck. A stunned Zombie may not interact with the game in any way. This includes shielding other Zombies from darts or continuing to run toward a Human. If shot while stunned, the Zombie’s stun timer is reset back to 10 minutes. If you are caught running past humans while stunned with your headband up to force them to waste ammo you are subject to a warning.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

        <h3>MED KITS AND CURES</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Med kits and Cures will be bought with points; points will be earned by attending missions or participating in special events.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Med kits: These cards do not expire. To use med kits, you give the Zombie the first aid code instead of your ID.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Cures: These cards expire in 48 hours. A Human must use this card on a Zombie to turn the Zombie into a Human. Cures must be used in the presence of a moderator.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
        <h3>OTHER RULES</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>The game is only valid on the NAU campus, but you can't run off campus grounds for safety, or else you will become a Zombie! Before you go off campus or get into a car, you must find cover from a building within campus grounds or stun the Zombie.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Orange Bandanas must be VERY visible and at least 2 inches wide.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>If both the Human and Zombie are inside, the Human cannot stun the Zombie, and the Zombie cannot tag the Human. Please leave the chaos for outside.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Blasting non-players (people not wearing an orange bandana) with darts or socks is a ban-able offense.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>People who are not registered participants may not directly interact with the game. This includes bringing food to Humans or Zombies who are camping or spying for either team.  Non-players may not restrain players for either side, as this is a safety concern.  If non-players are caught doing this they are subject to ban from signing up for future games, and the player who escaped or scored a feed because of a restraint is subject to ban.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>A Zombie must have both feet outside of a safe zone to tag a human. Humans can stun Zombies from anywhere inside of a safe zone. If this will block flow of traffic for non-players it is advised that players step away from the exit and wait until things are clear or move to another exit.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Zombies may not use shields to deflect foam darts or socks.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Athletes are safe during official practices and can choose whether or not to participate while walking to practice. If an athlete is not participating, they must wear the bandana around their forearm if they are a Human or around their neck (as if stunned) if they are a Zombie if allowed by their instructor or coach.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Required Academic Events: Similarly, students at required academic events are safe for the duration of the event (even if this event is in a free-play zone), but can choose whether or not they are safe on the way to or from the event.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Use of non-standard exits (i.e. windows, balconies, etc.) as escape routes or zombie transit is highly bannable.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Please attempt to free up your time for missions to keep it fun for everyone. Besides obvious academic and work excuses, don't be lazy. Get out there and have some fun!</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h3>USE COMMON SENSE CLAUSE</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Know your limits and do not attempt to do anything beyond your means.  Do not do anything that will endanger other individuals, players or otherwise.  Anyone caught endangering others are subject to ban.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		
        <h3>DBAG CLAUSE</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Don’t be a douchebag. Everyone plays Humans vs. Zombies to have fun, and the rules of HvZ only exist because we agree they do. That’s why the most important rule of Humans vs. Zombies is to treat your fellow players with respect, and gracefully accept when you have been tagged or stunned.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Please do NOT impersonate a mod or a police officer. This game is meant to be for fun and not meant to be taken that seriously so impersonating a mod goes against the spirit of this game. Impersonating an officer can be a criminal offense, so for your safety please refrain from creating any costume that too closely resembles any branch of law enforcement.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

        <h3>RULES FOR MISSIONS:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Don't play in the streets. If there is an escort mission, keep the planned path on the trails, or somewhere that will not disrupt traffic. Do not go through buildings, and keep it fun and safe!</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>Mission routes cannot be along streets for obvious safety hazards.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>For all missions, zombies will have a respawn point or a brood mother instead of a respawn timer.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

        <h3>ALWAYS REMEMBER:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p class='rulesparagraph'>This is a game. Have fun. Being a Human is only half of it, and by signing up to play the game, you are agreeing to play as a Zombie if you do get turned. </p>
				</li>
			</ul>
